UTD-CS4348-Project 1
emulating the CPU and main memory by forking processes

## **Project #1:  Exploring Multiple Processes and IPC**

**Due Date:   Saturday, March 2, 2024**

##

## **I.  Project Organization**


You should do the following pieces to complete your project.  Each piece is explained below:

- Code	60 points
- Output	30 points
- Summary	10 points

Each piece is separately graded.  A missing piece will result in losing all of the points for that piece.  


# **Code**

The actual code of your program should be in this section.    It should be nicely formatted with plenty of comments.  The code should be easy to read, properly indented, employ good naming standards, good structure, etc.  


# **Output**

Output will be graded by running your program on four sample programs posted on eLearning, plus one that you have written.  The one you write should be different from the samples and at least as complex.  Each is 6 points.



# **Summary**

The summary section should discuss three things:  (1) project purpose, (2) how the project was implemented, and (3) your personal experience in doing the project.  It should be at least one page in length. A summary that is lacking will not receive full credit.




## **II.  Project Description**

**Language/Platform**

The project must be written in C, C++, or Java.  

If using C or C++, you must use a Unix fork to create processes and a Unix pipe for communication.

If using Java, you must use the Runtime exec method to create processes and streams for communication.  

Your project will receive no credit if not using processes or if using threads instead of processes.

All code must run successfully on our cs1.utdallas.edu server or csgrads1.utdallas.edu server.

Any other method requires instructor approval.


### **Problem Overview**

The project will simulate a simple computer system consisting of a CPU and Memory.

The CPU and Memory will be simulated by separate processes that communicate.

Memory will contain one program that the CPU will execute and then the simulation will end.


**Objectives**

1) Learn how multiple processes can communicate and cooperate.
1) Understand low-level concepts important to an operating system.

**Problem Details**

CPU

  It will have these registers:  PC, SP, IR, AC, X, Y.
  
  It will support the instructions shown on the next page of this document.
  
  It will run the user program at address 0.
  
  Instructions are fetched into the IR from memory.  The operand can be fetched into a local variable.
  
  Each instruction should be executed before the next instruction is fetched.
  
  The user stack resides at the end of user memory and grows down toward address 0.
  
  The system stack resides at the end of system memory and grows down toward address 0.
  
  There is no hardware enforcement of stack size.
  
  The program ends when the End instruction is executed.  The 2 processes should end at that time.
  
  The user program cannot access system memory (exits with error message).



Memory

  It will consist of 2000 integer entries, 0-999 for the user program, 1000-1999 for system code.
  
  It will support two operations:
  
  read(address) -  returns the value at the address
  
  write(address, data) - writes the data to the address
  
  Memory will read an input file containing a program into its array, before any CPU fetching begins.
  
  Note that the memory is simply storage; it has no real logic beyond reading and writing.



Timer

  A timer will interrupt the processor after every X instructions, where X is a command-line parameter.
  
  The timer is always counting, whether in user mode or kernel mode.
  
  Interrupt processing
  
  There are two forms of interrupts:  the timer and a system call using the int instruction.
  
  In both cases the CPU should enter kernel mode.
  
  The stack pointer should be switched to the system stack.
  
  The SP and PC registers (and only these registers) should be saved on the system stack by the CPU.
  
  The handler may save additional registers. 
  
  A timer interrupt should cause execution at address 1000.
  
  The int instruction should cause execution at address 1500.
  
  The iret instruction returns from an interrupt.
  
  Interrupts should be disabled during interrupt processing to avoid nested execution.
  
  To make it easy, do not allow interrupts during system calls or vice versa.

**Input File Format**

Each instruction is on a separate line, with its operand (if any) on the following line.

The instruction or operand may be followed by a comment which the loader will ignore.

Anything following an integer is a comment, whether or not it begins with //.

A line may be blank in which case the loader will skip it without advancing the load address.

A line may begin by a period followed by a number which causes the loader to change the load address.

Your program should run correctly with the any valid input files.


**Sample Programs**

The input program filename and timer interrupt value should be command line arguments, for example:

    java Project1 program.txt 30

Here are two sample programs for illustration purposes:

This program gets 3 random integers and sums them, then prints the result. 

Note that each line only has one number.

    8   // Get 
    
    14  // CopyToX
    
    8   // Get
    
    16  // CopyToY
    
    8   // Get
    
    10   // AddX
    
    11   // AddY
    
    9   // Put 1
    
    1
    
    50  // End     

This program prints HI followed by a newline to the screen.  To demonstrate a procedure call, the newline is printed by calling a procedure.

    ## 1   // Load 72=H
    ## 72
    ## 9   // Put 2
    ## 2
    ## 1   // Load 73=I
    ## 73
    ## 9   // Put 2
    ## 2
    ## 23  // Call 11
    ## 11
    ## 50  // End 
    ## 1   // Load 10=newline
    ## 10 
    ## 9   // Put 2
    ## 2
    ## 24  // Return
